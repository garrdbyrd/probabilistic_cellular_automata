## About

This project was developed as part of the undergraduate honors thesis of Garrett Byrd for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Department of Mathematics.

This repository provides a framework for modelling probabilistic cellular automata. This framework heavily utilizes the NetworkX and Mesa packages to construct networks and model the interactions of its cells. Modules are available to export rudimentary animations/visualizations for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional rectangular lattice networks.

The distinctive attributes of the cellular automata built/analyzed in this project are:
1. Once a cell is infected, it remains infected until the end of the run.
2. Cells are infected based on local and global neighborhoods.
3. The underlying networks are of rectangular shape.

## Examples
The *examples* directory includes three .py files which serve as example models for probabilistic cellular automata in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. Each of these examples includes visualizations.
